      <h1>Tennessee: The Great Smoky Mountains Wildfire</h1>
      <small>By: Tommy Row</small>

      <p>
        The 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires were a complex of wildfires
        which began in late November 2016.

          By December 12, the fires had burned more than 10,000 acres (15 square
          miles) inside the national park, and 6,000 acres in other parts of the
          area. At least 14,000 area residents and tourists were forced to
          evacuate, while over 2,000 buildings were damaged and/or
          destroyed.[4][6]

          Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.
          - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change The current warming trend
          is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely
          (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human
          activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is
          unprecedented over decades to millennia.1 Earth-orbiting satellites
          and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the
          big picture, collecting many different types of information about our
          planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected
          over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.

          nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the
          mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared
          energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many
          instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels
          of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response. Ice
          cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers
          show that the Earthâ€™s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas
          levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean
          sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient,
          or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring
          roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery
          warming.3
